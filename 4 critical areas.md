## Knowledge

**Year 1–5:** You're building foundations. Learning feels effortful, slow. You forget much of what you read. Connections are sparse. You might wonder if you're making progress at all.

**Year 5–15:** Things start clicking. New material reminds you of something you learned years ago. You begin to see patterns across domains. Learning accelerates because you have mental scaffolding to hang new ideas on. You can hold your own in conversations with experts.

**Year 15–30:** You've developed genuine expertise in at least one area, and surprising breadth in others. You synthesize ideas in ways that feel original—not because you're smarter, but because your unique combination of knowledge creates novel intersections. People seek your perspective. You can learn a new adjacent field in months rather than years.

**Year 30+:** You've become a node of wisdom. You see how cycles repeat, how old ideas return in new forms. Teaching becomes natural because you understand the architecture of your own knowledge. The compound interest is invisible to outsiders—they just see someone who "gets it."

## Money

**Year 1–10:** Discouraging. You're saving diligently, maybe investing $500 a month. After a decade of discipline, you have perhaps $80,000–$100,000. It feels like a lot of sacrifice for modest results. Your peers who spent freely don't seem obviously worse off.

**Year 10–20:** The curve begins to bend. Your portfolio might double even without new contributions. You cross into six figures, then $200,000, then $300,000. The annual gains start exceeding your annual contributions. Something is shifting.

**Year 20–30:** Now it's unmistakable. Your money is working harder than you are. A single good year in the market might add more to your portfolio than five years of your savings ever did. You've crossed into territory where work becomes optional—not because you earned so much, but because you started early and never stopped.

**Year 30–40:** The numbers become almost absurd. Someone who invested $500/month starting at 25 might have $1.5–2 million by 65. More than half of that was generated in the final decade. The early years of sacrifice now look like the bargain of a lifetime.

## Health

**Year 1–5:** You notice modest improvements. Better energy, slightly better body composition. Nothing dramatic. Easy to quit because the payoff seems small relative to the effort.

**Year 5–15:** The gap between you and your sedentary peers widens quietly. You recover faster, sleep better, handle stress more easily. You've avoided the slow decline that your peers dismiss as "just getting older."

**Year 15–30:** Now the divergence is stark. You're doing things at 50 that your peers stopped doing at 35. Hiking, playing with grandchildren on the floor, traveling without physical limitation. More importantly, you've maintained the capacity to keep compounding—your body can still adapt and improve.

**Year 30+:** The difference is no longer about fitness; it's about independence. The compounders are living fully at 70 and 80: traveling, active, mentally sharp. Those who didn't compound often face cascading decline—one health issue leading to another, options narrowing. The investment made decades ago is now paying dividends in years of quality life.

## Relationships

**Year 1–5:** New friendships are exciting but shallow. You're collecting acquaintances. Professional relationships are transactional. You haven't been tested together yet.

**Year 5–15:** Some relationships have weathered difficulty—a conflict, a move, a life transition. These are now deeper. You've built a reputation among a small group as someone who shows up. Trust has accumulated.

**Year 15–30:** You have a handful of relationships that feel irreplaceable. These people know your history, your patterns, your growth. The shorthand runs deep. Professionally, your network has compounded—you're two degrees from almost anyone you need to reach. Opportunities arrive through relationships rather than applications.

**Year 30+:** The inner circle is small but profound. These are people who've known you across decades, through multiple versions of yourself. There's a richness here that cannot be built quickly. Meanwhile, your broader network has made you resilient—you have people to call in almost any situation, and they answer because of thirty years of accumulated trust.

## The Visual

If you graphed all four, you'd see the same shape: a long, flat early section where progress is barely perceptible, then a gradual curve upward, then a steep climb that arrives almost shockingly late. The person who quits at year five sees only the flat part. The person who persists to year thirty wonders why everyone isn't doing this.

That's the quiet deception of compounding—it hides its rewards until you've almost forgotten you were waiting for them.
